  abstract = {We analyse the properties of generalised method of moments-instrumental variables (GMM-IV) estimators of AR(1) dynamic panel data sample selection models. We show the consistency of the first-differenced GMM-IV estimator uncorrected for sample selection of Arellano and Bond (1991) (a property also shared by the Anderson and Hsiao,1982, proposal). Alternatively, the system GMM-IV estimator (Arellano and Bover, 1995, and Blundell and Bond, 1998) shows a moderate bias. We perform a Monte Carlo study to evaluate the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators. Our results confirm the absence of bias of the Arellano and Bond estimator under a variety of circumstances, as well as the small bias of the system estimator, mostly due to the correlation between the individual heterogeneity components in both the outcome and selection equations. However, we must not discard the system estimator because, in small samples, its performance is similar to or even better than that of the Arellano-Bond. These results hold in dynamic models with exogenous, predetermined or endogenous covariates. They are especially relevant for practitioners using unbalanced panels when either there is selection of unknown form or when selection is difficult to model.},

  abstract = {This article develops a framework for efficient IV estimators of random effects models with information in levels which can accommodate predetermined variables. Our formulation clarifies the relationship between the existing estimators and the role of transformations in panel data models. We characterize the valid transformations for relevant models and show that optimal estimators are invariant to the transformation used to remove individual effects. We present an alternative transformation for models with predetermined instruments which preserves the orthogonality among the errors. Finally, we consider models with predetermined variables that have constant correlation with the effects and illustrate their importance with simulations.},

  abstract = {The difference and system generalized method-of-moments estimators, developed by Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen (1988, Econometrica 56: 1371-1395); Arellano and Bond (1991, Review of Economic Studies 58: 277-297); Arellano and Bover (1995, Journal of Econometrics 68: 29-51); and Blundell and Bond (1998, Journal of Econometrics 87: 115-143), are increasingly popular. Both are general estimators designed for situations with "small T , large N" panels, meaning few time periods and many individuals; independent variables that are not strictly exogenous, meaning they are correlated with past and possibly current realizations of the error; fixed effects; and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation within individuals. This pedagogic article first introduces linear generalized method of moments. Then it describes how limited time span and potential for fixed effects and endogenous regressors drive the design of the estimators of interest, offering Stata-based examples along the way. Next it describes how to apply these estimators with xtabond2. It also explains how to perform the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation in a panel after other Stata commands, using abar. The article concludes with some tips for proper use. Copyright 2009 by StataCorp LP.},
